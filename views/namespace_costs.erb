      This page uses <a href="https://www.infracost.io">infracost</a>, which is moving to a subscription model.
      We are in the process of replacing this report with cost data from AWS, broken down by tags. But, the relevant
      tags were not in place, and/or were incorrect, prior to 2020-10-01, so full months of data are not yet
      available.

<p>
These are costs as reported by <a href="https://infracost.io">infracost</a>,
for AWS resources dedicated to each namespace.
Infracost only reports on a subset of AWS resources
(see their list of <a href="https://www.infracost.io/docs/supported_resources">supported resources</a>),
so some namespace resources may not be included in this report.
</p>

<p>
Shared costs, both AWS resources and the staff and ancillary costs of the Cloud Platform
team, are distributed evenly across all namespaces.
